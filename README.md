## About Me

As a highly motivated and goal-oriented developer, I am eager to bring my experience and passion for learning to a new team. With a strong background in Python, Git, SQL, and backend logic, I have honed my problem-solving, computer literacy, and communication skills over the years.

Most recently, I have focused on Web3 development, working on projects like Webscrapers and building various automation tools for the blockchain and NFT space. My hands-on experience with Etherscan, Blocknative, and Infura, has allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the Web3 ecosystem and navigate the barriers of uncharted territory.

I am a self-starter who thrives in challenging environments, and I am always eager to learn new technologies and methodologies. As I transition into a new phase of my journey, I am excited to join a team where I can contribute my skills and continue to grow as a developer. With a proven track record of success and a relentless drive for excellence, I am confident in my ability to make a significant impact in any organization that shares my passion for innovation and progress.
